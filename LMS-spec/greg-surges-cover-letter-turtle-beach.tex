    I'm writing to apply for the (position)} at {\bf company}. 
    I am an audio programmer and musician, with experience 
    in both technical and creative areas. 
    My current work involves developing computer software to generate, analyze, and understand
    music and musical structure.
    I am able to combine a strong analytical approach to problem-solving with
    a sense of aesthetics and subjective quality developed through my musical training.
    
    My professional experience and skill-set are varied, and include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Programming software and designing hardware for 3 unique electronic 
            music hardware / software devices.
            As the sole proprietor of my own startup company, I successfully
            created and launched these products, 
            including a successful funding campaign on Kickstarter. 
        \item Working as software developer for a variety of creative and research
            projects, including large-scale art installations, the development of 
            novel digital signal processing effects for electronic music production,
            and music software for generative composition and machine musical 
            improvisation.
            I have experience working on teams comprised of researchers and artists
            across multiple disciplines, and enjoy interfacing with people from a 
            variety of backgrounds.
        \item
            I am experienced using C/C++, Python, Processing, Max/MSP, Pure Data, and
            with developing VST plugins, external objects for Max/MSP and Pure Data,
            and standalone desktop applications using \\ PortAudio for real-time audio.
        %\begin{comment}
        \item Teaching various music and technology topics at the undergraduate level. 
            These courses include ``Introduction to Computers and Music,'' 
            ``American Experimental Music,'' and ``Music Theory Fundamentals.'' 
        %\end{comment}
        \item Published research on signal-processing effects, open-source music
            hardware design, generative music, and networked computer music performance.
            I have been published by Springer, the American Association for
            Artificial Intelligence, the International Computer Music Conference, and
            the Stockholm Musical Acoustics Conference / Sound and Music Computing Conference,
            and have presented my work both across the U.S. and internationally.
    \end{itemize}
